📂 Project Overview:

I had the opportunity to work on a project where I explored, analyzed, and manipulated a credit score dataset obtained from Kaggle. The goal was to build a machine learning model for effective credit score classification.

💡 What I Did:


* 🔍 Explored and preprocessed the dataset to understand its complexities and ensure data quality.
* 📈 Conducted in-depth data analysis to discover trends, patterns, and relationships.
* 🧮 Utilized clustering techniques to identify customer segments.
* 🧰 Engineered features to enhance model performance.
* 🤖 Developed three different machine learning models, including ExtraTrees, RandomForest, and XGBoost.
* 📊 Evaluated model performance using the "One vs Rest" technique, ROC AUC, and presented results with visualizations and insights.
* 📝 Drew conclusions and insights based on the best-performing model.

👩‍💻 Technology Stack:
* 🐍 Python, Google Colab
* 📦 Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, xgboost

I'm delighted to have completed this project, and I invite you to check out the details of my workflow and results. Your feedback and collaboration are always highly welcome!
