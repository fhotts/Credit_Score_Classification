Hello and welcome to my evolving data science portfolio! While I may not have an extensive collection of projects just yet, I'm enthusiastic about my journey into the world of data science. Here, I'm taking my first steps towards mastering this fascinating field.

As a student currently pursuing an MBA in Data Science & Artificial Intelligence and studying statistics, I'm eager to share my early data science experiments and projects with you. These projects represent my commitment to learning and applying data-driven techniques to various challenges.

Although my portfolio is modest at this stage, it's a testament to my dedication to mastering the art of data science. I believe in the power of data to reveal insights and drive innovation, and I'm excited to develop my skills further as I work on more projects.

Thank you for visiting my portfolio. Feel free to delve into the details of each project, explore the code, and provide feedback. I'm always eager to learn and grow in this exciting field.
